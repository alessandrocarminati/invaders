# Invaders

I wrote up this code back in 1997 to prove my university "Computer Organization and Design" professor that I had an in-depth understanding of how CPUs work.
It is written using Borland Pascal, at the time I used as a linker and main generator because the rest was written in assembly x86 Real-Mode for i386.
